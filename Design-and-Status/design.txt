Goal: To create a fully functional file browser with the following features:
    - Read in a file
    - Interpret three tags: <a>, <br>, and <p>
    - Display the aforementioned file
    - Display a user interface
    - Provide error messages to the end-user
    - Allows for the use of links created by <a> tag to open other files in the same directory
    - Allows the user to go back to a previously opened file

    - UI Class (UI.h and UI.cpp):
        - Display calls the display function from buffer and adds style elements. Also prints UI elements that 

    - Buffer Class (Buffer.h and Buffer.cpp):

        -
